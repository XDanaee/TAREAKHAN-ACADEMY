       Its flora and fauna are very exotic and there are species that you can only find on that island, such as the pink Okdom-gui fish. The culture on the island is also different than in the rest of the country, with local traditions such as that women are in charge of diving and obtaining seafood and fish without using any diving equipment.<br>
